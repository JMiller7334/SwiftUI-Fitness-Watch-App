# SwiftUI-GymTrackerWatch

## Overview:
Prototype wearable(watch-OS app) I designed as a concept companion app to my published app: Iron Journal.
I decided not go the route of a wearable to act as an addition to my app for the time being so this acts as demo.

 + Written in Swift in Xcode using SwiftUI     
 + Demo walks user through a workout. Utilizes picker view to prompt user inputs.
 + Session/workout deta updates as inputs are made. Is displayed to the user as they progress through the workout.
 + Hardcoded history data and workout data - due to app not being connected to a database of anykind.
   + Number of exercises/sets/etc can be changed; app will adapt.
   + Any number of exercises or sets my be used.
  
## Project Goals:
+ Further familiarize myself with swfit UI
+ Create a concept for a potential addon to my published app.
