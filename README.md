# SwiftUI-GymTrackerWatch

## Overview:
Prototype wearable(watch-OS app) I designed as a concept companion app to my published app: Iron Journal.
I decided not go the route of a wearable to act as an addition to my app for the time being so this acts as a demo.

 + Written in Swift in Xcode using SwiftUI
 + MVVM architecture    
 + Demo walks user through a workout. Utilizes picker view to prompt user inputs.
 + Session/workout deta updates as inputs are made. Is displayed to the user as they progress through the workout.
 + Hardcoded history data and workout data - due to app not being connected to a database of any kind.
   + Hardcoded workout can be changed(via code) and the app will adapt.
   + App adapts to whatever number exercises and sets that are configured to the workout class(testWorkout).
  
## Project Goals:
+ Practice developing wearable/watch apps.
+ Further familiarize myself with SwiftUI.
+ Better familiarize myself with MVVM architecture.
+ Create a concept for a potential addon to my published app.
